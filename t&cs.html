            <h1>aftercare</h1>
            <ol type= "1" >
                <li>Be extra careful within 24 hours after a manicure and avoid intense heat such as hot bath, saunas or spa pools to avoid lifting and chipping issues.
                </li>
                <li>Use cuticle oil twice daily. This helps to make your nails grow healthier, stronger and longer. It also helps prevent your gel polish from lifting.</li>
                <li>Always wear gloves while cleaning, gardening, washing and using harmful chemical to avoid staining your manicure.
                </li>
                <li>Wash your hands after using insect repellents, tanning solutions, purple shampoos, sunscreens and chlorine as this product can chip, discolor and stain your manicure.
                </li>
                <li>Never use your nails as a tool as this will damage and weaken your natural nails.</li>
                <li>Do not pick, file and push your cuticles back as this can break the seal of the gel or extension, which will lead to chipping and damaging your nails.</li>
                <li>Do not miss your appointments for maintenance. We recommend you not to go more than two to three weeks to avoid chipping issues and follow any advice given to you by your nail technician.</li>
            </ol>
