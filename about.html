            <p>I am Sapana, originally from Nepal- the land of Mount Everest.</p>
            <p>
            Business has always been a passion for me, and owning L’amour Nails NZ
            has been a dream come true. From a young age, I enjoyed painting and
            designing my own nails, as well as doing it for friends and family as
            a hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
            A turning point came after a Whipple surgery in 2017, during recovery,
            I realized that doing nails and art work was my true passion. This led
            to master my skills and boost my confidence in the nail industry by
            attending Monaco Nail Academy. Since 2018, I have been a fully
            qualified and NZ certified nail artist, turning my passion into a
            profession.
            </p>
            <p>
            I operate a home-based boutique nail studio, where I provide
            personalized premium manicure services tailored to each client's
            individual needs. I am passionate about creativity, and this is
            reflected in my hand-painted nail art.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have furthered my education and skills through various courses and
            training programs at the Monaco Nail Academy, including Soft Gel
            Extension, Mixed Media &amp; Hand Painted Nail Art, E-file, and IBX
            Treatment. I have also trained in Mozhzheri Russian Manicure, covering
            Russian Classic Manicure, French Manicure, and Macro Manicure.
            Additionally, I have taken courses with Natalie Holt in Builder Gel
            and Nail Art. I continually up-skill to stay up-to-date with current
            trends and provide the finest nail care services.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a pet lover and have a super cute fur baby- Rocco, who is
            friendly and loves to meet new people.
            </p>
            <p>I am excited to bring your beautiful nail visions to life.</p>
